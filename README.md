# typed-latex

Lexing/parsing is heavily inspired by [Texlab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab/tree/master) and [Rowan](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rowan).
It might be overkill, but I'd rather have good parsing than bad (even if it's not necessarily required).

## Running

Currently uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to executing typescript without any annoying configuration.
Execute `index.ts` with `make run`.
